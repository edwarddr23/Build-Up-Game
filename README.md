# Build-Up-Game in 4 Different Languages and Paradigms
1. C++ (Object Oriented Programming)
2. LISP (Functional Programming)
3. Java Android (Event Driven Programming)
4. Prolog (Logical Programming)
5. 
Each of these was written in ~3 weeks each when I had not previously learned LISP, Java Android, or Prolog.
